## FAQ

**Do modifiers stack?**
Modifiers do not stack. If the player has two modifiers of the same type, only the highest tier will be applied. For example, if the player has a Vitality 3 ring, and a Vitality 2 belt, they will get three hearts and not five. If the modifiers are of the same tier, only the first one detected will be applied. Players **can** use multiple unique modifiers at the same time, only the same modifiers will not stack.
